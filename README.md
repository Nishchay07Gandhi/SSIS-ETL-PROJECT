"# SSIS-ETL-PROJECT" 

 Hello everyone, 

  In this project I have used a data of a car servcing company .
  The file size was big enough to fit in excell so i have divide the file into two parts and check it and join it back together.
 For the ETL (EXTRACT, TRANFORM,LOAD)   ,i have firts used MICROSOFT VISUALN STUDIO (MSVS) / SSIS for removing bad records and transfering it to SQl SERVER
 and then cleaned the data using SSAS

 The Query is also showed in the project and data i have used
